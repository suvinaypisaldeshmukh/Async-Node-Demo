We first import the fs (File System) module, which provides functions for working with the file system.
We use the readFile function to read the contents of a file named example.txt. This operation is asynchronous, so it doesn't block the execution of other code.
The callback function is executed when the file reading operation is complete. If there's an error, it will be passed as the first argument (err). Otherwise, the data read from the file will be passed as the second argument (data).
We log the file content if reading is successful. Otherwise, we log the error.
Lastly, we log a message indicating that we're reading the file asynchronously. This message may appear before or after the file content, depending on when the file reading operation completes.
This example demonstrates how Node.js leverages asynchronous I/O operations to perform tasks like file reading without blocking the execution of other code.
